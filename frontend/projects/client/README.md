# Api Client
This api client is what we use to interface with our backend services.
Anytime you make an api change in the backend services, you should regenerate this api client.

## Regeneration Instructions
1. Ensure you have the latest lts version of java installed
2. Run the backend server in `http` mode locally
3. Run the `generate` script in this project.
