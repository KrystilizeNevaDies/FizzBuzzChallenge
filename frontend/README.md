# FizzBuzzChallenge Frontend

This is the frontend component of the FizzBuzzChallenge webapp.

### Setup
1. Ensure you have all requirements
   - Latest Node LTS
   - Yarn
2. run `yarn install`

### Run
To run in development mode, run `yarn dev`.

Running in development mode also requires you to run the backend, consult the backend's docs for more information on how
to do this.

### Build
To build for production, run `yarn build`

Keep in mind this builds to `projects/pages/dist`.

### More Info

Project is organised into three yarn workspaces, `client`, `common`, and `pages`.

- `client` - Autogenerated api client to our internal endpoints.
- `common` - Non-ui logic and api client staging.
- `pages` - The frontend pages and routing.

### Future Features

- Migrate to JsonSchema-based visual editor
  - `npx ts-json-schema-generator --path 'src/logic/game.ts' --type 'Game'`
  - The idea is that if you create a sufficiently usable generic json-schema based json editor, you can avoid
    all the platform-specific ui logic and focus more on clarity.
- Live-Preview game condition state in editor

### Things to do before submission:
- Reread pdf document
- Add info to each element in the editor
- Setup vite equivalent of webpack env variables. Replace hardcoded url with config
- Enforce no negative in backend
- Gracefully handle errors when calling the backend
